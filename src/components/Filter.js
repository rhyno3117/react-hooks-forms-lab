//Determine where you need to add state for this feature. 
//What components need to know about the search text?

//Once you've determined which component should hold the state for this feature, 
//set up your initial state, and connect that state to the input field. 
//Remember, we're trying to make this input a controlled input â€” 
//so the input's value should always be in sync with state.

//After you've connected the input to state, 
//you'll also need to find a way to set state when the input changes. 
//To get the test passing, you'll need to use a prop called onSearchChange as a callback.

//Finally, after making those changes, 
//you'll need to use that state value to determine which items are being displayed on the page, 
//similar to how the category dropdown works.
